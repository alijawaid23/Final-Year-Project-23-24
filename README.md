# Final Year Project
My final-year project focused on building a web application connecting students in the UK to small, local businesses through student discounts. The application will allow small businesses to connect with students and create supplementary revenue streams, in a market traditionally dominated by larger businesses.

Due to the limited time allocated for project completion, I focused on implementing a high-fidelity prototype of the application's main screen. This approach allowed me to gather essential user feedback and validate the core functionality, which includes searching for offers, claiming discounts, rating offers, and managing offers. An Admin portal was created that allows the admin to update/ delete offer details and images. This main screen is a crucial representation of the application's overall concept, showcasing its potential to stakeholders and guiding further development. The decision to prioritise this segment of the application was strategic, ensuring that the development was manageable as a solo developer and that the project aligned with user needs and expectations. I followed the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern to ensure better code organization and manageability.  The tech stack used included PHP and MySQL for backend operations, along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end, providing a robust and scalable foundation for this web application.
