# Final Year Project
Due to limited time allocated for the project completion only part of the application was implemented. After completing High Fidelity Prototypes, user feedback was gathered based on the prototype that was built. The users gave the heads up for implementing the high-fidelity prototype in code. A portion of the code was chosen that would best represent the idea behind the web application. The users agreed to the implementation of the appâ€™s main screen that would have offers from different businesses. This is the main page of the app which would give an actual representation of what the app is about with functionalities such as searching, claiming discounts, rating offers, uploading offer images, and adding and updating offers. 
The tech stack used for this project includes PHP, and MYSQL on the backend along with HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
