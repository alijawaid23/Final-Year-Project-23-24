# Final Year Project
•	My final-year project focused on building a web application connecting students in the UK to small, local businesses through student discounts. The application will allow small businesses to connect with students and create supplementary revenue streams, in a market traditionally dominated by larger businesses. 
•	Ranked 3rd across the Computer Science department (120+ candidates) with a distinguished 87% grade; my project was selected as an epic sample for future years, filmed for Kingston University advertisements, and featured on their social media platforms.
•	Tech Stack Used: High-Fidelity Prototype: Figma; Backend: PHP, MYSQL; Frontend: CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Ajax
